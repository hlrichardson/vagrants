# ovn-vagrant: Virtual OVN Cluster using Vagrant

Install vagrant and libvirt provider:

```bash
sudo yum install -y vagrant
sudo yum install -y vagrant-libvirt
```

Avoid having to enter credentials every time vagrant uses 
libvirt:

```bash
sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} libvirt
newgrp libvirt
```

Checkout this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlrichardson/vagrants
cd ovn-vagrant
```

Create CentOS VMs (OVN central and two OVN compute nodes)

```bash
vagrant up --provider libvirt
```

Look around in central node:
```bash
vagrant ssh central
sudo ovn-sbctl show
exit
```

Look around in compute1 node:
```bash
vagrant ssh compute1
sudo ovs-vsctl show
exit
```

Look around in compute2 node:
```bash
vagrant ssh compute2
sudo ovs-vsctl show
exit
```

When done, clean up:

```bash
vagrant destroy
```
